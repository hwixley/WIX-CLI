# Contributing to the WYX-CLI

1. Create a fork of WYX-CLI
2. Pick up one of the issues if not already underway or assigned. Please comment on the issue that you are working on it, to prevent clashing with other developers.
3. Create a PR from your fork into master and assign @hwixley to review it.
4. @hwixley will review it as soon as he can :)

## General Code Practice

- When creating a new command/feature make sure to list it in the list of commands on the `README.md` and the output of the `wyx` command in the correct format.
